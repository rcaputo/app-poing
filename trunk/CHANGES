2000.05.24 - Release 1.01
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

poing was looking for modules that weren't needed.  These included
Filter::HTTPD, which in turn wanted HTTP::Request, which wanted URI as
well as LWP, which would import the world.  I took the unnecessary
modules out.  Thanks to mstevens for finding this.

This is the initial public release.
