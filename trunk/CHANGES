2000.06.?? - Release 1.02
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I discovered the snort network monitoring tool today.  I also
discovered that snort sees ICMP echo requests without data as "large"
ICMP packets.  Specifically, they trigger "IDS246 - MISC - Large ICMP
Packet" alerts.  The work-around is to specify a single data byte,
which this version now does.

Magister submitted a patch to align host name/alias groups.  It's
prettier, but it eats a lot of screen with whitespace.  Applied the
patch anyway.

2000.05.24 - Release 1.01
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

poing was looking for modules that weren't needed.  These included
Filter::HTTPD, which in turn wanted HTTP::Request, which wanted URI as
well as LWP, which would import the world.  I took the unnecessary
modules out.  Thanks to mstevens for finding this.

2000.03.26 - Release 1.00

This is the initial public release.
